ASP.NET 5


Setting Up Our Environment

Install Homebrew
Install Node.js
Install Yeoman
Install Yeoman ASP.NET templates
Install Git (or GitHub?)
Install VS Code
Install ASP.NET 5

Do you have to install Mono???
    I think so... in order to run Kestrel








TODO

    Where do packages get stored on the Mac OS X file system?
        How do you view hidden folders in the finder???





    How do you view the list of available versions???

    Why can't I get intellisense to work in VS Code???



    How do I get detailed error messages to display in the browser?
        Aha! app.UseErrorPage()
        http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/fundamentals/diagnostics.html

    Try out Entity Framework 7
        Test code first work flow against Azure database
        In memory database???
            What is this about???


Watch ASP.NET Community Standups on YouTube.com
    8/28 Standup
        Some great community links



Roadmap

Pro Tips
    Make sure that your versions line up
        There is a lot of change right now... so mixing and matching versions will often break your apps



Agenda

1) Install ASP.NET 5
2) Install VS Code (optional)
3) Scaffolding an App
4) ASP.NET Quick Tour
5) Publishing to Azure Using GitHub Integration

Things to Cover

1) What is .NET Core
2) What is Kestrel
3) What are the components of ASP.NET 5 (dnvm, dnu, dnx)
4) How is the ASP.NET different



Managing Versions

List of dnx versions
    https://github.com/aspnet/dnx/releases

To install a different version
    dnvm install 1.0.0-beta7

Switch to a different version
    dnvm use 1.0.0-beta7
    dnvm use 1.0.0-beta7 -r coreclr

To change your default version
    dnvm use 1.0.0-beta7 -p

Note: When using coreclr you cannot build using the .NET 4.5.1 target

"frameworks": {
  "dnx451": {},
  "dnxcore50": {}
},




Diagnostics

To view the runtime information...
    app.UseRuntimeInfoPage();
    http://localhost:5000/runtimeinfo
    Shows where the packages are being loaded from

BUILD 2015 - Introducing ASP.NET 5







BUILD 2015 - ASP.NET Deep Dive

Command Line Tools
    dnvm - Version manager
    dnx - Execute app
    dnu - Everything else

project.json - commands
    Defines the entry point(s) for your app
    "web" - References Microsoft.AspNet.Hosting looks for Startup class in your project

DI
    Now baked into the platform
    IApplicationEnvironment is an example of a dnx type that you can ask for in the Startup class
    You can inject into Controllers, Views, and Tag Helpers
    ILoggerFactory is an new logging mechanism that is available to inject into your Controllers

global.json
    You can add additional source code paths to this configuration file
    dnx will then attempt to load your dependencies from that path

Class Library (Project)
    dnx project without wwwroot folder
    Produces a Nuget package
    You can still just add it to a web project by adding a reference
    You can build your project against multiple frameworks
        You no longer need to link files into separate projects
    You get a target combo box to select the framework
        You'll only see compilation errors for the selected framework
        VS Code will actually show you errors for all of your target frameworks
    dnx builds from source so by default you get any output from a Class Library project
        Go to the project defaults to enable output
        Creates a Nuget Package
            You can use Nuget Package Explorer to view the contents of the package
            Within the package are the .dlls
                Stored within TFM (Target Framework Moniker) folders
    "dnu build" - builds the project
    "dnu pack" - creates the package

Tag Helpers
    Can be kept anywhere in your project
    You just need to implement an interface (or inherit from a base class)
    The interface just has two members
        Order property
        ProcessAsync() method
    The name of the Tag Helper class is important
        "RepeatTagHelper" results in a Tag Helper element named "repeat"
    The Tag Helper can be an element or attached to existing elements as an attribute
    Tag Helpers need to be declared in the _GlobalImport.cshtml view
        _ViewStart.cshtml contains all of your global imperative code
        _GlobalImport.cshtml contains all of your declarative statements
    In Razor, Tag Helper element attribute values are C# code

Commands
    Start with a dnx Console App project
    Publish to a Nuget package
    Allows that Nuget package to be installed by others
    Once installed that command is now available globally from the command line







Pluralsight Course Notes

The Big Three Changes

New Project System
    File based project system
        No project file
        No longer need to manage merge conflicts in .csproj
    Dynamic compilation
    New default folder structure

Cloud Optimized Core CLR
    Fast and lean runtime for the server
    CLR wrapped in a NuGet package
    Runs outside of Windows

Unification
    MVC 6 == ASP.NET MVC + Web API
    Less overhead, less duplication
    No System.Web

Walkthrough

Show how adding files to the file system adds files to your project
Show that you can add a .cs file through the file system and it will dynamically compile into the app
Models, controllers, views, Razor, etc. are all still here
The root of the website is no longer the root of the project
    wwwroot is the root of the site
    Contains all of the static content for the site (CSS and JS)
    Views are not contained in wwwroot because they are compiled
No web.config file
No Global.asax(.cs) file

Project Dependencies
    Specified using the project.json file
    NuGet package manager is no longer a dialog (yay!)
    You can also just edit the project.json file (with Intellisense)
    Packages are no longer stored in a "packages" Solution folder
        See the .kpm folder under your user folder
    The References folder in the Solution Explorer provides a nice visual dislay of your dependencies

ASP.NET 5 vs ASP.NET 5 Core
    Full .NET framework vs core framework
    Core framework is ~1/10 of the size... so stuff is missing
    List of frameworks is listed in the project.json file
        The project will be compiled for every framework listed
    Intellisense will tell you what properties and methods are not available in the Core framework
    Can use "#if" directives to provide code for specific frameworks
        ASPNET50 vs ASPNETCORE50
    Project Properties dialog allows you to specify your runtime
    Runtime .dlls are stored in the .kre folder under your user folder

kre - "k" runtime environment
    Loads your application into the app domain
    Project settings allows you to specify which target to use when debugging
    The Core CLR is stored in the /Users/bitmask/kre folder
    NuGet packages are stored in the /Users/bitmask/kpm folder

Class Libraries
    Uses the same compilation model as the web application project
    global.json "sources" property specifies where source code can be found
    The project.json dependencies can reference class libraries
        ASP.NET will always look in the source and test folders for projects that match the dependency name

Startup and Middleware
    Startup class is the entry point
    Used to configure the application
    You can use app.Run() to write content to the context
    You can use app.UseWelcomePage() to display generic welcome page

Startup and MVC Services
    Add the Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc package
    Two phase startup... ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection) and Configure(IApplicationBuilder)
        services.AddMvc();
        app.UseMvc();
    Add a Home controller with an Index() method and you're good to go
    Customizing a route is easy
        app.UseMvc(routes => routes.MapRoute("default", "{controller=Home}/{action=Default}"));
    Attribute based routing is also still available with some minor improvements
        [Route("/[controller]")] or [Route("/[action]")]

Injecting Services
    Configure services on the DI container using the services.AddInstance<>() method
        Alternative method is AddSingleton()
    AddScoped() is per request instance
    AddTransient() is per call instance

Working with Configuration
    Add a config.json file to the root of the project
    Add the Microsoft.Framework.ConfigurationModel.Json package
    Configuration = new Configuration()
        .AddJsonFile("config.json")
        .AddEnvironmentVariables();

Web API Controllers
    Same base controller type as standard MVC controllers
    "Accept" header can be used to indicate what content type you want
